The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Clone, pull and fetch verify each signature with the strict per-object
  check that `kit verify` uses. The batched Ed25519 fast path accepted some
  torsion-padded signatures that the strict check rejects, so fetch and
  `kit verify` could disagree on a commit signed by its own key holder. The
  `batch-verify` feature of `kit-core` and `kit_core::sign::verify_batch` are
  removed.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-28

### Added

- The `kit` command-line tool and the `kit-*` library crates.
- The `libkit` crate. It gives programs the same typed operations that the
  `kit` command runs: history, working tree, merge, rebase, remotes, grants,
  transfer, keys, attestation and git interop.
- The installer `install.sh`, served from `kit.storage`. It requires a cosign
  signature check by default.
- The release workflow `release.yml`. It signs each archive with cosign
  keyless signing, adds SLSA build provenance, and publishes a CycloneDX SBOM.
